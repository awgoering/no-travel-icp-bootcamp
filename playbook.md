# "No Travel Required" IBM Cloud Private Bootcamp

![alt text](https://github.com/awgoering/no-travel-icp-bootcamp/blob/master/images/WearyTraveler.PNG "No more sleeping in airports")

## Overview

Mixed/blended delivery for a virtualized IBM Hybrid Cloud Administration Bootcamp.  Mix of live sessions with SMEs, recorded sessions, recorded demonstrations, required readings, lab exercises, checkpoints, and final test/quiz.  The content covered would be equivalent to the content in the instructor-lead IBM Hybrid Cloud Administration Bootcamp. 

Students register for the class through Skills Gateway and commit, just as they would commit to a classroom delivery. Content covered in 2-3 hour blocks for 5-10 days.  Labs available for 10 days.  Students must complete required elements such as sessions, readings, lab exercises and quizzes to earn badge.  Completion of these elements can be tracked and reported by Moodle.

## How to use this playbook

This section will describe the process to build, publish and publicize a blended "no travel required" bootcamp.

## Agenda

The agenda can be ........................................... 

### Sample Agenda

This is a sample agenda from a business partner delivery in May 2019.  This agenda had a large percentage of live sessions, with just a few recordings and readings.  Here is the link to the [sample agenda](https://github.com/awgoering/business-partner-icp-bootcamp/blob/master/business-partner-agenda.md)

### Agenda Template

The agenda template can be used to create an agenda for a new/existing bootcamp. Copy and rename the .md file.  Make adjustments to the module names, lab names, presentor name(s), notes and day themes. 

Here is the link to the [agenda template](https://github.com/awgoering/no-travel-icp-bootcamp/blob/master/agenda-template.md)

## Dynamic Learning Platform

[Link to a model or template for our course.](https://www.onlinedigitallearning.com/course/view.php?id=3279)  

## SODA

The SODA (Services Offering Directory Application) offering can be found [here](https://soda.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/show/1136). You should contact the Offering Manager listed on the offering sheet.  

## Instructor Pool

SMEs commit to deliver their "specialty" in the scheduled time slot.  The coordinatar needs to identify and get commitment from SMEs to be available and teach. SME commitment should be no more than 1-3 hours per day max. Some instructors may need to only commit for one to two sessions during the week.  If you do not have the appropriate resource, reach out to Lab Services, GTS and others for SMEs with specific expertise on topics identified in the agenda. 

This is the [current list of instructors.](https://github.com/awgoering/no-travel-icp-bootcamp/blob/master/instructor-pool.md)
